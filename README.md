# SkinDiseaseProject
The skin disease detection project uses deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze and classify skin diseases from images. The system is built with a Flutter front-end for user interaction and a Flask back-end for processing and predictions, enabling early detection and improved treatment outcomes.
